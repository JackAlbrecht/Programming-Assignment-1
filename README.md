# Programming-Assignment-1
This is a programming assignment for Eric Davashal at Whatcom Community College
In this program we use arithmetic and trigonometry to create equations that we solve in python.
I wasn't sure how many notes I should've put due to this being math, so I apologize if they are sparce.
